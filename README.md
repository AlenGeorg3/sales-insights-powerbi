# Sales Insights Dashboard using PowerBI

This project aims to provide a comprehensive and dynamic view of an organization's sales performance by utilizing data visualization techniques. This dashboard will be designed to enable sales teams, managers, and executives to track sales performance metrics, identify trends, and gain insights into their customer behavior.

The data used in the project is available freely on GitHub. This data will be cleaned, transformed, and modeled to ensure accuracy and consistency. The project will also involve the development of custom measures and calculations to derive meaningful insights from the data.

The sales insights dashboard consists of three pages of interactive visualizations, including charts, graphs, and tables, that will provide users with a comprehensive view of their sales performance. The dashboard will be designed to allow users to drill down into the data to investigate specific areas of interest further. The dashboard will also feature filters, slicers, and other interactive components to enable users to slice and dice the data based on their needs.

The Sales insights dashboard will be developed using Power BI, a powerful and user-friendly business intelligence tool that enables the creation of compelling and interactive dashboards. The dashboard may be deployed to an organization's internal network or cloud platforms, allowing authorized users to access it securely from anywhere.

Overall, the project will help organizations to gain a better understanding of their sales performance, identify areas for improvement and make data-driven decisions to drive revenue growth.
