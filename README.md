# Sales Insights Dashboard using PowerBI

This project aims to provide a comprehensive and dynamic view of an organization's sales performance by providing three pages of interactive visualizations, including charts, graphs, and tables. The dashboard is developed using Power BI.

The dashboard was built by following [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhZ62IlTxYs&list=PLeo1K3hjS3uva8pk1FI3iK9kCOKQdz1I9) youtube series by codebasics. The dataset was also provided. This data was cleaned, transformed, and modeled to ensure accuracy and consistency. Custom measures and calculations like Profit Margins, Revenue Contributions, etc. were developed to derive meaningful insights from the data.

The dashboard will be designed to allow users to drill down into the data to investigate specific areas of interest further. The dashboard will also feature filters, slicers, and other interactive components to enable users to slice and dice the data based on their needs.
